# Monitor Job Progress

After a pipeline starts a job, you can run one of the following commands
to monitor its status:

* `pachctl list pipeline`

  This command shows all pipelines that run in your cluster
  and their current status. Jobs for each pipeline will finish with either
  `success` or `fail` status.

  **Example:**

  ```bash
  NAME    VERSION INPUT                 CREATED       STATE / LAST JOB    DESCRIPTION
  montage 1       (edges:/ тип images:/)  2 seconds ago starting / starting A montage pipeline
  edges   1       images:/*             2 seconds ago running / starting  An edge detection pipeline.
  ```

* `pachctl list job`

  This command shows jobs that were run for each pipeline. For each job,
  Pachyderm shows the number of datums in the **PROGRESS** section, the amount
  of downloaded and uploaded data, duration, and other important information.

  **Example:**

  ```bash
  svetlanakarslioglu@Svetlanas-MBP examples % pachctl list job
  ID                               PIPELINE STARTED       DURATION           RESTART PROGRESS    DL       UL       STATE

  ```

* `pachctl list commit <first-repo-in-dag>`

  This command, when ran against the first repo in your DAG,
  shows the status of the downstream commits further in the DAG.
  In the [Hyperparameter Tuning example](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/ml/hyperparameter), we have four pipelines,
  or a four-stage pipeline. Every consequent pipeline takes the results
  in the output repository of the previous pipeline and performs a
  computation. Therefore, each step is executed one after another.
  The **PROGRESS** bar in the output of the `pachctl list commit <first-repo-in-dag>`
  command reflects these changes.

  The following animation shows how the progress bar is updated
  when a job for each pipeline completes.
